1. **Enter Post Title** - Add the name of the post in this field.
      
2. **Add Content** - Add the content of the post here.
      
3. **Publish/Save the Post** - This is where posts are saved as drafts, can be previewed, and finally published. 
      
      The "Status" indicates whether the post is in draft, pending review, or published status.
      The "Visibility" indicates whether the post is public, password protected, or private. Posts will most likely always be public.
      The "Publish" field can be edited to publish the post at a date in the past, immediately, or in the future.
      While creating the post, it's important to click "Save Draft" and "Preview" along the process to make sure everything saves and looks correct.
      Once the post is ready to be published (after the following steps are complete and previewed), click the "Publish" button.
            
4. **Categorize the Post** - This is where events are categorized. This makes it so the web visitor can separate the posts by type. **If you want the post to show up on the blog page, categorize it with "blog" in addition to any other categories.**
      
5. **Update the Post's SEO** - Filling out this section with relevant words will help with the Search Engine Optimization for the post. 
 
6. **Add Tags to the Post** - Add tags to the post here. Be sure to seperate tags with commas.
     
7. **Set the Post's Featured Image (760px width x 300 height)** - Add a featured image for the post. This will be the image that shows up as the banner for the post as well as the blog listing page. The image should be approximately 760px width x 300 height


# II. Add an Image

**To add an image for any event, blog post, sponsorship, etc., click "Media" > "Add New" and follow the steps below.**

In order to edit an image, the image will need to be open in the media library. It is recommended to use the following image sizes:**
* Speaker image - 200px width x 200px height
* Logo image - 260px width
* Featured image - 3000px width x 800 height
* Blog post featured image - 760px width x 300 height
