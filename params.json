Posts will most likely always be public.\r\n      The \"Publish\" field can be edited to publish the post at a date in the past, immediately, or in the future.\r\n      While creating the post, it's important to click \"Save Draft\" and \"Preview\" along the process to make sure everything saves and looks correct.\r\n      Once the post is ready to be published (after the following steps are complete and previewed), click the \"Publish\" button.\r\n            \r\n4. **Categorize the Post** - This is where posts are categorized. This makes it so the web visitor can separate the posts by type. **If you want the post to show up on the blog page, categorize it with \"blog\" in addition to any other categories.**\r\n      \r\n5. **Update the Post's SEO** - Filling out this section with relevant words will help with the Search Engine Optimization for the post. \r\n \r\n6. **Add Tags to the Post** - Add tags to the post here.
